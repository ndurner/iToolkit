## Overview
### What's this
My personal collection of helper utilities for iOS

### What's there
- Alarm Clock

## Alarm Clock
+ Allows you to dismiss alarm events before the actual alarm goes off. No need to disarm the alarm clock if you wake up before the alarm and activate it again when you go to bed.
+ Works with Silent Mode on
+ Does not need to run in the foreground

### Caveats
+ does not override Do Not Disturb mode
+ really barebones, uses private Apple APIs
